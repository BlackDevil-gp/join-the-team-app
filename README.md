# This project is a code test

for [Epiceros](https://www.epiceros.com/).

It's a conversion of this reference app to [CodePen](https://codepen.io/StoraH/pen/MWJGbzM) into a React App.

## Installation instructions

1. Click on the "Clone or download" button on the right side of the page.

2. If you want to download the project as a zip file, click on "Download ZIP." If you prefer to clone the repository using Git, click on the "Use HTTPS" link to copy the URL of the repository.

3. If you chose to download the zip file, extract it to a directory of your choice.
If you chose to clone the repository, open a terminal or command line window, navigate to the directory where you want to download the project, and run the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/BlackDevil-gp/join-the-team-app.git`

4. After cloning the repository, navigate into the project directory and install any necessary dependencies by running the following command:

### `npm install`

5. Once all dependencies are installed, you should be able to run the project by running the following command:

### `npm start`

6. This should start a local development server and open the project in your default browser.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
